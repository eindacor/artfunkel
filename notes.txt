---------------------------mechanics---------------------------
players have a museum
within the museum is a permanent collection and gallery spaces
the permanent collection is persistent, and can be modified at any time
the galleries are arranged by the player and set for a specific duration (1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours)
the first x% of the gallery duration is the "opening event", which grants special bonuses for visitors
players cannot modify paintings within a gallery until the end of the event
forcing a gallery to close reduces rep considerably and the player incurs a penalty

players can contact gallery owners to purchase works, setting can be turned off by gallery owner
