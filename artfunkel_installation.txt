Installation
----------------------------------------

		Getting the Files:

First, make sure you download and install the Github App for Windows from the link above. Start the app, and login with your account information.

Next, go online, log in to Github.com, and go to the url: https://github.com/eindacor/artfunkel

On the right hand side, there's a button labeled "Clone in Desktop". Click the button, and the Github App should launch. 

Be sure to make a note of the target directory specified. You'll need to find this directory again to run the application. You can easily find the directory by selecting the project on the left-hand side of the Github app, right clicking on the name and selecting "Open in Explorer".

On the left panel of the Github App, you should see "artfunkel". Select it, if it isn't selected already, and find the "Sync" button in the upper-right-hand corner of the App. Beside the button there should be a blue indicator that new files need to be downloaded, showing a number and an arrow. Click the button. Note: this might take a while, as this is downloading all of the game assets to your local machine. Thankfully, this is a one-time process. The files may need to be updated occasionally, but this is the bulk of the content.


		Running the Application:

To run the application, you need to download and install Microsoft's Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for VS 2013 from the link above. Make sure you specify "vcredist_x86.exe" when you do. Once it downloads, follow the installation instructions.

After the packages are installed, go to the directory where all of the game files were downloaded, and run "artfunkel.exe".
